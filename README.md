# finalProject--Rollercoaster Tycoon

Project Description:
Goal is to earn as much money and have as many attractions in your amusement park as possible.
As your number of attractions increase, so does your attraction level (which determines the number of people who visit your park and thus, the amount of money you earn).
Restrictions are that if a person eats before they ride a rollercoaster, they will barf and the attraction level of your amusement park will decrease. A solution is to buy janitor(s), who clean up the barf and bring your attraction level back to normal. 

Directions to use it:
Press on which utility or attraction you want in your park, hold and release where you want that item to go. 

DAY BY DAY CHANGELOG
