# finalProject--Rollercoaster Tycoon

  PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Goal is to earn as much money and have as many attractions in your amusement park as possible.
As your number of attractions increase, so does your attraction level
Attraction level determines the number of people who visit your park.


If a person eats before they ride a rollercoaster, they will barf
Barf decreases attraction level of your amusement park.
A solution is to buy janitor(s), who clean up the barf and bring your attraction level back to normal. 

  HOW TO PLAY
Click and drag a utility or attraction that you want in your park to place it.
